      <h2>INTRODUCTION<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>These notes are meant to serve as a very brief introduction to the accompanying MATLAB image correlation spectroscopy code.
         They are not intended to be a comprehensive lesson on the underlying theory of ICS, or an introduction to MATLAB.  For those
         details, see the references given at the end of this webpage.
      </p>
      <p>The MATLAB code in this tutorial is in a <tt>monospaced font</tt>.  It can simply be copied from this page to the command window.  All of the ICS .m files in the unzipped directory should
         be added to the MATLAB path: File --&gt; Set Path... --&gt; Add with Subfolders...  You'll need the Optimization and Image Processing
         Toolboxes to use all of the included .m files.
      </p>
      <p>Most of the included ICS .m files have a (small!) help section, which can be called by <tt>'help filename'</tt>.  All comments and suggestions are very much appreciated, and can be sent to <a href="mailto:david.kolin@gmail.com">david.kolin@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>SIMULATOR<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>A simulation of fluorescently labeled particles imaged on a confocal microscope can be generated using simul8tr.m, which has
         the following syntax:
      </p>
      <p><tt>simulation = simul8tr(sizeX,sizeY,sizeT,density,bleachType,bleachDecay,qYield,pixelsize,                        timesize,PSFType,PSFSize,PSFZ,noBits,diffCoeff,flowX,flowY,flowZ,
                                   countingNoise,backgroundNoise);</tt></p>
      <p>where:</p>
      <p><tt>sizeX</tt> and <tt>sizeY</tt> are the dimensions of the simulation, in pixels.
      </p>
      <p><tt>density</tt> is the particle density in particles per um^2.
      </p>
      <p><tt>bleachType</tt> determines if the fluorophores bleach, and is either <tt>'none'</tt> for no bleaching or <tt>'mono'</tt> for a monoexponential decay in average intensity.
      </p>
      <p><tt>bleachDecay</tt> determines how quickly particles bleach. It is the rate constant for the monoexponential bleaching, in the same units at
         the time step (usually between 0 and 0.05, given 1 Hz imaging rate).
      </p>
      <p><tt>qYield</tt> is the quantum yield of the fluorophores (usually 1).
      </p>
      <p><tt>pixelsize</tt> is the size of a pixel, in um (usually ~0.1).
      </p>
      <p><tt>timesize</tt> is the time between frames, in seconds (usually ~1).
      </p>
      <p><tt>PSFType</tt> gives the shape of the point spread function of the imaging system. It is either <tt>'g'</tt> for a 2D Gaussian, or <tt>'a'</tt> for an airy disk.
      </p>
      <p><tt>PSFSize</tt> is the e^-2 radius, in um, for a Gaussian PSF, or the distance to the first zero of the airy disk, in um.
      </p>
      <p><tt>PSFZ</tt> is the size, in um, for the Z dimension of the PSF.  For 2D simulations, set this to 0.  The PSF in Z is always a Gaussian,
         regardless of <tt>PSFType</tt>.
      </p>
      <p><tt>noBits</tt> is the number of bits used in the image normalization, imitating a A/D converter (usually 12).
      </p>
      <p><tt>diffCoeff</tt> is the diffusion coefficient, in um^2/s.
      </p>
      <p><tt>flowX</tt>, <tt>flowY</tt>, and <tt>flowZ</tt> are the flow speeds in each of the directions, in um/s.
      </p>
      <p><tt>countingNoise</tt> is the noise associated with the PMT amplification electronics (see the August 2005 Costantino BJ paper for details).  Usually
         between 1 and 20.
      </p>
      <p><tt>backgroundNoise</tt> is the noise associated with spurious background counts (see the same paper).  Usually between 0 and 0.3.
      </p>
      <p>As an example, let's create a simulated image series with the following characteristics: 256 x 256 pixels with 100 images,
         10 particles per um^2, 1 s per image, 0.1 um/pixel, particles with a quantum yield of 1, a Gaussian convolving function with
         an e^-2 radius of 0.4 um, with particles diffusing at 0.01 um^2/s, and no noise
      </p><pre class="codeinput">imageSeriesDiff = simul8tr(256,256,100,10,<span class="string">'none'</span>,0,1,0.1,1,<span class="string">'g'</span>,0.4,0,12,0.01,0,0,0,0,0);
</pre><p>The first image in the series should look something like this:</p><pre class="codeinput">imagesc(imageSeriesDiff(:,:,1))
axis <span class="string">image</span>
colormap(gray)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_01.png"> <h2>SPATIAL ICS (ICS)<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>We can determine number densities and aggregation states using ICS.  First, we calculate a 2D spatial autocorrelation function
         (SACF) for each image in the simulation which we created earlier:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">ICS2DCorr = corrfunc(imageSeriesDiff);
</pre><p>The SACF of an image should be a 2D Gaussian.  We can view the SACF for first image:</p><pre class="codeinput">s=surf(ICS2DCorr(:,:,1));
axis <span class="string">tight</span>
colormap(jet)
xlabel(<span class="string">'\eta'</span>,<span class="string">'FontSize'</span>,12)
ylabel(<span class="string">'\xi'</span>,<span class="string">'FontSize'</span>,12)
zlabel(<span class="string">'r(\xi,\eta)'</span>,<span class="string">'FontSize'</span>,12)
set(s,<span class="string">'LineStyle'</span>,<span class="string">'none'</span>)
title(<span class="string">'Spatial Autocorrelation Function for First Image'</span>)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_02.png"> <p>Next, we crop the stack of SACFs around the central peak, since the fitting algorithms work better when the noise at higher
         spatial lags is removed.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">ICS2DCorrCrop = autocrop(ICS2DCorr,12);
</pre><p>As an example, let's look at the SACF of the first image to see how much was cropped:</p><pre class="codeinput">s=surf(ICS2DCorrCrop(:,:,1));
axis <span class="string">tight</span>
colormap(jet)
xlabel(<span class="string">'\eta'</span>,<span class="string">'FontSize'</span>,12)
ylabel(<span class="string">'\xi'</span>,<span class="string">'FontSize'</span>,12)
zlabel(<span class="string">'r(\xi,\eta)'</span>,<span class="string">'FontSize'</span>,12)
set(s,<span class="string">'LineStyle'</span>,<span class="string">'none'</span>)
title(<span class="string">'Cropped Spatial Autocorrelation Function for First Image'</span>)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_03.png"> <p>These cropped SACFs are fit to a 2D Gaussian:</p>
      <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_eq441477.png"> </p>
      <p>which can be accomplished by:</p><pre class="codeinput">a  = gaussfit(ICS2DCorrCrop,<span class="string">'2d'</span>,0.1,<span class="string">'n'</span>);
</pre><p>returing the fit parameters in <tt>a</tt>. Recall that 0.1 is the pixel size set in the simulation above, and the <tt>'n'</tt> refers to no whitenoise (there would be whitenoise with real data).  We can now plot the fitted Gaussian as well as the raw
         correlation function for the first image:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">plotgaussfit(a(1,1:6),ICS2DCorrCrop(:,:,1),0.1,<span class="string">'n'</span>)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_04.png"> <p>Finally, we can calculate the average cluster density using the amplitudes of the fitted Gaussians:</p><pre class="codeinput">particlesPerBeamArea = 1/(mean(a(:,1)))
beamArea = pi*mean(a(:,2))*mean(a(:,3))
density = particlesPerBeamArea/beamArea
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">particlesPerBeamArea =
    4.9948
beamArea =
    0.5091
density =
    9.8104
</pre><p><tt>density</tt> should be close to the 10 particles/um^2 which we set in the simulation.
      </p>
      <h2>TEMPORAL ICS (TICS)<a name="14"></a></h2>
      <p>We can extract diffusion coefficients and flow rates using TICS.  First, we calculate the temporal autocorrelation function
         (TACF) for our diffusion simulation, given 1 second time sampling
      </p><pre class="codeinput">GtDiff = tics(imageSeriesDiff,1);
</pre><p>For samples undergoing 2D diffusion, the TACF has the following analytical form:</p>
      <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_eq516464.png"> </p>
      <p>Let's fit the first 20 lags of the temporal autocorrelation function to the 2D diffusion model</p><pre class="codeinput">diffCoeff = difffit(GtDiff(1:20,1),GtDiff(1:20,2));
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">Optimization terminated: relative function value
 changing by less than OPTIONS.TolFun.
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_05.png"> <p>The diffusion coefficient can be calculated from the fitted parameter in <tt>diffCoeff</tt> and the beam waist of the laser:
      </p>
      <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_eq60534.png"> </p>
      <p>Or, in MATLAB:</p><pre class="codeinput">w = mean(a(:,2))
D = w^2/(4*diffCoeff(2))
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">w =
    0.4062
D =
    0.0107
</pre><p>The beam radius, <tt>w</tt>, should be close to the set value, 0.4. The diffusion coefficient <tt>D</tt>, should be close to the set value 0.01.
      </p>
      <h2>SPATIO-TEMPORAL ICS (STICS)<a name="22"></a></h2>
      <p>STICS measures the velocity of flowing particles.  Let's generates an image series with 5 particles/um^2 immobile, 5 particles/um^2
         flowing with direction "down-left" i.e., x component 0.0707 um/s, y component -0.0707 um/s.  The pixel size will be 0.06 um,
         and the time resolution 0.1 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>This gives a total speed of sqrt(2(0.0707^2)) = 0.1 um/s.</p><pre class="codeinput">imageSeriesFlow = simul8tr(256,256,100,[5 5],<span class="string">'none'</span>,[0 0],[1 1],0.06,0.1,<span class="string">'g'</span>,0.4,0,12,[0 0],[0.0707 0],[-0.0707 0],[0 0],0,0);
</pre><p>The function <tt>velocity</tt> performs the STICS analysis:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">[Vx,Vy] = velocity(imageSeriesFlow,0.1,0.06,<span class="string">'y'</span>,20,<span class="string">'n'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">Current plot held
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_06.png"> <p>where the analysis was performed up to lag 20, <tt>'y'</tt> denotes immobile filtering, with time resolution 0.1s and pixel size 0.06 um. <tt>'n'</tt> denotes no whitenoise (there would be with real data).  When prompted, select end of the "linear" region of the plot.  Because
         this simulation has high S/N and temporal coherence, the plot should be linear over the range displayed.  Just click somewhere
         on the right hand side (i.e., high tau) of the plot.  <tt>Vx</tt> and <tt>Vy</tt> will be calculated, and should agree with the set velocity components of 0.071 and -0.071.  The magnitude of the velocity
         measured by STICS is given by <tt>V</tt>:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">V = sqrt(Vx^2+Vy^2)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">V =
    0.1052
</pre><p><tt>V</tt> should be close to the set speed, 0.1um/s Let's compare this result with TICS.  As with diffusion, we calculate the TACF,
         given 0.1 second temporal sampling:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">GtFlow = tics(imageSeriesFlow,0.1);
</pre><p>For samples undergoing 2D flow, the TACF has the following analytical form:</p>
      <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_eq530260.png"> </p>
      <p>We can fit the first 60 lags of the simulation TACF to this model:</p><pre class="codeinput">flowCoeff = flowfit(GtFlow(1:60,1),GtFlow(1:60,2));
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_08.png"> <p>The flow speed can be calculated from this fit:</p>
      <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ICSTutorial_eq89431.png"> </p>
      <p>Or, in MATLAB:</p><pre class="codeinput">v = w/flowCoeff(2)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">v =
    0.0977
</pre><p><tt>v</tt> should be close to <tt>V</tt>, the speed recovered from the STICS analysis. Finally, we can calculate the % immobile:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">percentImmobile = flowCoeff(3)/(flowCoeff(1)+flowCoeff(3))*100
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">percentImmobile =
   46.5158
</pre><p><tt>percentImmobile</tt> should be close to 50, the value set in the simulation.
      </p>
      <h2>IMAGE SERIES IMPORTING AND MANIPULATION<a name="34"></a></h2>
      <p><b>Importing Image Series</b></p>
      <p>A 16-bit Fluoview TIFF image series can be imported using <tt>rd_img16</tt>:
      </p>
      <p><tt>image_data=rd_img16(filename)</tt>;
      </p>
      <p>where <tt>filename</tt> a string which contains the filename to load.  (e.g., <tt>'C:\MyData\ImageSeries.tif'</tt>.)  Similary, <tt>rd_imgser</tt> can load 8-bit RAW files:
      </p>
      <p><tt>image_data=rd_imgser(filename,sizex,sizey,numimg)</tt>;
      </p>
      <p>where <tt>sizex</tt> and <tt>sizey</tt> are the dimensions of an image, and <tt>numimg</tt> is the number of images in the series.
      </p>
      <p>If the file is a Fluoview TIFF and the image series was collected on an Olympus microscope, <tt>FluoInfo</tt> can extract data collection parameters from the file header:

% |'none'| for no bleaching or |'mono'| for a monoexponential decay in
% average intensity.
%
% |bleachDecay| determines how quickly particles bleach. It is the rate constant
% for the monoexponential bleaching, in the same units at the time step
% (usually between 0 and 0.05, given 1 Hz imaging rate).
%
% |qYield| is the quantum yield of the fluorophores (usually 1).
%
% |pixelsize| is the size of a pixel, in um (usually ~0.1).
%
% |timesize| is the time between frames, in seconds (usually ~1).
%
% |PSFType| gives the shape of the point spread function of the imaging system.
% It is either |'g'| for a 2D Gaussian, or |'a'| for an airy disk.
%
% |PSFSize| is the e^-2 radius, in um, for a Gaussian PSF, or the distance
% to the first zero of the airy disk, in um.
%
% |PSFZ| is the size, in um, for the Z dimension of the PSF.  For
% 2D simulations, set this to 0.  The PSF in Z is always a Gaussian,
% regardless of |PSFType|.
%
% |noBits| is the number of bits used in the image normalization, imitating
% a A/D converter (usually 12).
%
% |diffCoeff| is the diffusion coefficient, in um^2/s.
%
% |flowX|, |flowY|, and |flowZ| are the flow speeds in each of the
% directions, in um/s.
%
% |countingNoise| is the noise associated with the PMT amplification
% electronics (see the August 2005 Costantino BJ paper for details).  Usually between 1 and 20.
%
% |backgroundNoise| is the noise associated with spurious background counts
% (see the same paper).  Usually between 0 and 0.3.
%
% As an example, let's create a simulated image series with the following characteristics:
% 256 x 256 pixels with 100 images, 10 particles per um^2, 1 s per image,
% 0.1 um/pixel, particles with a quantum yield of 1, a Gaussian convolving function
% with an e^-2 radius of 0.4 um, with particles diffusing at 0.01 um^2/s, and no noise

imageSeriesDiff = simul8tr(256,256,100,10,'none',0,1,0.1,1,'g',0.4,0,12,0.01,0,0,0,0,0);
%%
% The first image in the series should look something like this:

imagesc(imageSeriesDiff(:,:,1))
axis image
colormap(gray)

%% SPATIAL ICS (ICS)
% We can determine number densities and aggregation states using ICS.  First, we calculate a
% 2D spatial autocorrelation function (SACF) for each image in the simulation which we created earlier:

ICS2DCorr = corrfunc(imageSeriesDiff);
%%
% The SACF of an image should be a 2D Gaussian.  We can view the SACF for first image:

s=surf(ICS2DCorr(:,:,1));
axis tight
colormap(jet)
xlabel('\eta','FontSize',12)
ylabel('\xi','FontSize',12)
zlabel('r(\xi,\eta)','FontSize',12)
set(s,'LineStyle','none')
title('Spatial Autocorrelation Function for First Image')
%%
% Next, we crop the stack of SACFs around the central peak, since the
% fitting algorithms work better when the noise at higher spatial lags is
% removed.

ICS2DCorrCrop = autocrop(ICS2DCorr,12);
%%
% As an example, let's look at the SACF of the first image to see how much was cropped:

s=surf(ICS2DCorrCrop(:,:,1));
axis tight
colormap(jet)
xlabel('\eta','FontSize',12)
ylabel('\xi','FontSize',12)
zlabel('r(\xi,\eta)','FontSize',12)
set(s,'LineStyle','none')
title('Cropped Spatial Autocorrelation Function for First Image')

%%
% These cropped SACFs are fit to a 2D Gaussian:

%%
% 
% $$r\left(\xi,\eta\right) \ = g\left(0,0\right)\ e^{ -\frac{\xi^{2}+\eta^{2}}{\omega_{o}^{2}}} + g_{\infty}$$
%  

%%
% which can be accomplished by:
a  = gaussfit(ICS2DCorrCrop,'2d',0.1,'n');

%%
% returing the fit parameters in |a|.
% Recall that 0.1 is the pixel size set in the simulation above, and the |'n'| refers to no whitenoise
% (there would be whitenoise with real data).  We can now plot
% the fitted Gaussian as well as the raw correlation function for the first
% image:

plotgaussfit(a(1,1:6),ICS2DCorrCrop(:,:,1),0.1,'n')
%%
% Finally, we can calculate the average cluster density using the
% amplitudes of the fitted Gaussians:

particlesPerBeamArea = 1/(mean(a(:,1)))
beamArea = pi*mean(a(:,2))*mean(a(:,3))
density = particlesPerBeamArea/beamArea
%%
% |density| should be close to the 10 particles/um^2 which we set in the
% simulation.

%% TEMPORAL ICS (TICS)
% We can extract diffusion coefficients and flow rates using TICS.  First,
% we calculate
% the temporal autocorrelation function (TACF) for our diffusion
% simulation, given 1 second time sampling
GtDiff = tics(imageSeriesDiff,1);
%%
% For samples undergoing 2D diffusion, the TACF has the following
% analytical form:
%%
% 
% $$ r \left( 0,0,\tau \right) \  = g \left(0,0,0\right) \ \left(1+ \frac{\tau}{\tau_{d}}\right)^{-1} + g_{\infty}$$
% 
%%
% Let's fits the first 20 lags of the temporal autocorrelation function to
% the 2D diffusion model
diffCoeff = difffit(GtDiff(1:20,1),GtDiff(1:20,2));
%%
% The diffusion coefficient can be calculated from the fitted parameter in
% |diffCoeff| and the beam waist of the laser:
%%
% 
% $$D = \frac{\langle\omega_{0}\rangle^{2}}{4\tau_{d}}$$
% 
%%
% Or, in MATLAB:
w = mean(a(:,2))
D = w^2/(4*diffCoeff(2))
%%
% The beam radius, |w|, should be close to the set value, 0.4.
% The diffusion coefficient |D|, should be close to the set value 0.01.
%% SPATIO-TEMPORAL ICS (STICS)
% STICS measures the velocity of flowing particles.  Let's generates an image series with 5 particles/um^2 immobile, 5 particles/um^2 flowing with direction "down-left"
% i.e., x component 0.0707 um/s, y component -0.0707 um/s.  The pixel size
% will be 0.06, and the time resolution 0.1 seconds.
%
% This gives a total speed of sqrt(2(0.0707^2)) = 0.1 um/s.
imageSeriesFlow = simul8tr(256,256,100,[5 5],'none',[0 0],[1 1],0.06,0.1,'g',0.4,0,12,[0 0],[0.0707 0],[-0.0707 0],[0 0],0,0);
%%
% The function |velocity| performs the STICS analysis:
[Vx,Vy] = velocity(imageSeriesFlow,0.1,0.06,'y',20,'n');
%%
% where the analysis was performed up to lag 20, |'y'| denotes immobile
% filtering, with time resolution 0.1s and pixel size 0.06 um.
% |'n'| denotes no whitenoise (there would be with real data).  When
% prompted, select end of the "linear" region of the plot.  Because this
% simulation has high S/N and temporal coherence, the plot should be linear over the range displayed.  Just click somewhere on the right hand
% side (i.e., high tau) of the plot.  |Vx| and
% |Vy| will be calculated, and should agree with the set velocity components of 0.071 and -0.071.  The magnitude
% of the velocity measured by STICS is given by |V|:
V = sqrt(Vx^2+Vy^2)
%%
% |V| should be close to the set speed, 0.1um/s
% Let's compare this result with TICS.  As with diffusion, we calculate
% the TACF, given 0.1 second temporal sampling:
GtFlow = tics(imageSeriesFlow,0.1);
%%
% For samples undergoing 2D flow, the TACF has the following analytical
% form:
%%
% 
% $$r \left(0,0,\tau \right) \ \ =g \left(0,0,0\right)\ \ e^{-\left(\frac{\tau}{\tau_{f}}\right)^{2}} + g_{\infty}.$$
% 
%%
% We can fit the first 60 lags of the simulation TACF to this model:
flowCoeff = flowfit(GtFlow(1:60,1),GtFlow(1:60,2));
%%
% The flow speed can be calculated from this fit:
%%
% 
% $$\left|v\right| = \frac{\langle\omega_{0}\rangle}{\tau_{f}}$$
% 
%%
% Or, in MATLAB:
v = w/flowCoeff(2)
%%
% |v| should be close to |V|, the speed recovered from the STICS analysis. 
% Finally, we can calculate the % immobile:
percentImmobile = flowCoeff(3)/(flowCoeff(1)+flowCoeff(3))*100
%%
% |percentImmobile| should be close to 50, the value set in the simulation.

%% IMAGE SERIES IMPORTING AND MANIPULATION
%
% *Importing Image Series*
%
% A 16-bit Fluoview TIFF image series can be imported using |rd_img16|:
%
% |image_data=rd_img16(filename)|;
%
% where |filename| a string which contains the filename to load.  (e.g.,
% |'C:\MyData\ImageSeries.tif'|.)  Similary, |rd_imgser| can load 8-bit RAW files:
%
% |image_data=rd_imgser(filename,sizex,sizey,numimg)|;
%
% where |sizex| and |sizey| are the dimensions of an image, and |numimg| is
% the number of images in the series.
%
% If the file is a Fluoview TIFF and the image series was collected on an Olympus
% microscope, |FluoInfo| can extract data collection
% parameters from the file header:
%
% |[XDim,YDim,TDim, PMTVoltage, PMTOffset, PMTGain, LaserPower] = FluoInfo(filename);|
%
% where |XDim| and |YDim| are the pixel sizes, in um, in the X and Y directions,
% and |TDim| is the time between images, in seconds.  |PMTVoltage|,
% |PMTOffset|, and |PMTGain|, give the PMT settings, and |LaserPower| is
% the laser intensity, in percent.
%
% *Correcting for Background Noise*
%
% Background intensity counts can be subtracted from an image series using
% |wnCorr|:
%
% |imageSeriesCorrected = wnCorr(imageSeries);|
%
% You will be prompted to select a background region.  Its mean will
% be subtracted from the image series.
%
% *Cropping a Region for Analysis*
%
% An image series can be cropped to select a region of interest using
% |serimcrop|:
%
% |croppedImageSeries = serimcrop(imageSeries);|
%
% You will be prompted to interactively select the region of interest.
